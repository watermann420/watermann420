Hi, I’m Yannis  a developer and creator focused on building open, long term
creative technology.

I’m the main developer behind **MusicEngine**, **MusicEditor**, and a custom
**GameEngine**, forming an ecosystem that combines real-time audio, live coding,
MIDI, visuals, and interactive systems.

My goal is to build powerful tools that are:
- free and open source
- technically solid and performance-oriented
- flexible enough for music, games, tools, and experimental projects

These projects are developed independently, driven by curiosity, experimentation,
and a strong belief in open ecosystems. I’m especially interested in bridging
audio engines, game technology, and creative workflows in ways that are usually
locked behind closed or expensive software.

MusicEngine and its related tools are still evolving, but they are built with
long-term sustainability in mind  prioritizing architecture, clarity, and
creative freedom over short-term hype.
